title: "Hello world!"

I never imagined I would be starting a blog. And for that I must thank [Rach](https://rachsmith.com/why-write/) [Smith](https://rachsmith.com/fuck-it/), [Chris](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/05/11/🧠💭✏%EF%B8%8F/) [Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/06/27/there-is-no-bar/), [Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/take-care-of-your-blog-/) and [Matthias Ott](https://matthiasott.com/notes/just-put-stuff-out-there). Their posts gave me the courage to go ahead and start blogging.

In true developer fashion though, I ended up redesigning my website in the process of writing this post.[^1]

I was[^2] nervous to write a _public_ blog. Moreover, I had no idea what I was going to write about. So, I immediately went back to doing something more in my comfort zone — endlessly redesigning this website.

It wasn’t a waste of time though. I like the design… _for the time being_[^3]. Plus it gave me something to write about.

In the end:

- <s><span class="vh">This text has been striked out.</span>It doesn’t even matter[^4]</s>
- I hope this blog becomes a record of what I’m learning.
- I hope it becomes a journal, one I can read years down the line, to understand the ways in which I may have changed.

For now, it’s time to publish.

[^1]: To be honest, I started redesigning the website even before I had written a single word.
[^2]: I still am nervous.
[^3]: <q>I am perpetually unsatisfied with it</q> as [Jim Nielsen](https://twitter.com/jimniels/status/1573873793138835458/photo/1) puts it for his personal website.
